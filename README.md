"Guess the Direction" is a game in which the player is randomly given one of the four cardinal directions and must then point their phone as close to that direction as possible! Once the player presses the "Submit Answer" button, they are shown how close they were to their goal direction and are given a score based on how many degrees off they were! Additionally, the player may switch to a second screen at any time and view their previous scores in a ranked list, from best to worst. This app was 
created for entertainment purposes for all audiences.
